# 🧩 Rubik's Cube Solver

An interactive **Rubik’s Cube Solver** built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (no external libraries or frameworks).

This project provides:
- A clean UI with buttons to rotate each face (`U`, `R`, `F`, `D`, `L`, `B`)
- Color-coded text-based cube representation
- `Scramble` and `Solve` functionality
- An object-oriented cube logic with move history tracking
